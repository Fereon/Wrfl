# Wrfl
A simple application to calculate rpg events with modified dices.

This application requires Python 3 and Matplotlib to be executed. The application was written using Pythton3.6.3 and Matplotlib2.1.0
Please make sure your Python environment and Matplotlibpackages are up to date.

In a serious case of Windows, use the "install_matplotlib.bat" file to install or update Matplotlib. (Administrator mode may be required if Python is installed in a protected directory. (ie. "C:/Program Files/Python36/")

"Wrfl.bat" will automatically run the application using pythonw.

Keep in mind that Python must be included in PATH for this to work!
